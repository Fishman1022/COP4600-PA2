ChatGPT was first used to outline a plan for the assignment's design and to create a starting point for the rest of the group members to work off.
I started off first by using chatGPT to make the hash table structure, implement creation fucntions, as well as setting up a github for other members 
to use as an uploading platform. The prompts I used generally asked for similar instructions as in the assignment, occasionally providing additional info by way of 
sample files or other research I could find on the internet. Frequently, I would ask chatGPT to make sure specific instructions were followed, such as always following the given command structure, making sure it followed every command, and also making sure paramaters such as UPDATE made sure to use a key and a priority, as well as an updated salary float to keep things consistent. If an error or inconsistency occurred, sometimes I would paste the error into chatGPT and ask it to find a solution. Oftentimes, however, I ended up fixing most errors myself.

Gemini was also a tool I used to finish up the rest of the project. I mostly used gemini to update the parser given to me by Caleb, as well as to modularize all the final code given by the rest of the group. The group did a great job, but I thought it would be good to modualrize and make different source files to keep things comparmentalized. Gemini was also used to consult for different issues, such as commands being issued earlier than anticipated, and for solutions to the race conditions our code frequently ran into (The solution ended up being to use a long delay timer). Finally, making sure our output was correctly formatted and followed the right rules, as well as making sure our log logic worked was handled by Gemini as well. Comments, file structure, and input/output reading were handled by Gemini, as well as the finalization of the hashTable logic. Overall, AI was very instrumental to the assignment working.
